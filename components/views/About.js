    <p>This Bill Tracker is designed to help you get a quick, big-picture look at your bills and income situation from week to week.</p>
    <p>Once youâ€™ve added your bill, income and payment sources into the Data page, as you enter each payday into the app, it will
      create a Bill Payment Schedule and display how much of your pay is left once the bills for that period have been paid.</p>
